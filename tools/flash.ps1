# Why a script: the sequence (wait for fastboot, flash boot, reboot, then read a
# panel photograph against a table of expected values) is done dozens of times per
# bring-up session, and every step of it has been got wrong at least once --
# flashing while the phone is still booting Android, forgetting that `fastboot
# boot` is unsupported on MTK LK, or reading the wrong version of the panel
# legend.  The legend is printed here so it cannot drift from the image.
#
# Nothing in this script is destructive beyond the boot partition, and -Restore
# exists for exactly that reason.

Flashed. The panel comes up in a few seconds and then stays put (the watchdog is
disarmed, and the console wraps instead of scrolling), so there is no rush.

What to photograph: ONE shot of the whole lower half -- it must include the three
thin strip rows, the verdict patch and the three rows of cells.

  y 1172  cyan strip    P_before: MSDC_PS, the driver's very first read
  y 1186  white strip   PS_AND: bits that stayed high during the hand-sent CMD1
  y 1200  cyan strip    PS_OR:  bits that were high at some point during it
  x 400..560 y 1197     verdict patch
  y 1216  dots          blue = block devices (x 8), green = volumes (x 380)
  y 1400/1448/1496      stage cells.  16..23 are MsdcDxe's; this driver does
                        not paint them any more, so they stay the M4 evidence.
  text area             PS before=.. DAT=FF CMD=1 CD=1 / PWRAP init=.. failed=..
                        VEMC=.. en=N ANA=.. vosel=N NNNNmV / VMC=.. VIO18=..
                        BUS OK | DAT-LOW | CMD-LOW | RAIL-OFF | NO-WRAP
                        MUX strap=.. mode=N m0=.. m1=..  DIN 122..133=....
                        PING a I=.. R=.. / PING b I=.. R=.. / MUX ...

Reading it, in this order:

  0. The power question is already answered on hardware: PS = 0x81FF0002 means
     DAT = 0xFF and CMD = 1 (DAT is bits 23..16, CMD is bit 24), and VEMC's
     enable bit is set.  The card has power and a clean bus.

  1. The CMD line, bit 24 -- a square at x ~530 on the two CMD1 strips:
       AND bit24 = 1, OR bit24 = 1   the controller never drove CMD -> host side
                                     (clock / pad / pin mux), not the card.
       AND bit24 = 0, OR bit24 = 1   the command did go out and the card stayed
                                     silent -> clock reaching the card, or reset.

  2. PING a / PING b: CMDRDY is bit 8 of I.  If either one sets it, the card is
     alive and R= holds its OCR (bit 31 set = powered up).

  3. MUX: if PING b (the other pin-mux mode) answers and PING a did not, the
     mode was the whole blockage -- say so, it changes InitGpio.

  4. DIN 122..133: bit0 = GPIO122 ... bit11 = GPIO133.  A pin stuck at 0 while
     the rest are 1 is a line held from outside (RSTB candidate).
